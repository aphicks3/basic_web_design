    <h2>Welcome to My Website!</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Amanda. I live in the beautiful Sequatchie Valley
        in Tennessee. I have three siblings: one younger brother and two 
        older sisters. I also have two pets: a cat named Louie, who is 
        spoiled rotten and a beautiful dog named Luna. I like to read 
        sometimes, and I also love going to the movies!</p>
    
    <p>One thing about me is that I was diagnosed with type one diabetes
        when I was 13. However, I still live a pretty normal life. Here 
        are some things to know.</p>
        <p>* You can't get this type of diabetes from eating too much sugar.</p>
        <p>* I have to give myself insulin with shots; I use Novolog and Levemir pens instead of vials.</p>
        <p>* I wear a Dexcom G7 to monitor my glucose levels, so I don't have to prick my fingers every day.</p>
        <p>* It's important to keep my blood sugar levels in a certain range to keep me healthy.</p>

    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    <p>In the future, I plan to open my own bakery. After I graduate
        Chattanooga State this coming spring, it would be great to find 
        a job that would help me gain experience, not only with baking 
        but also with running my own small business. I know it'll be difficult,
        but I would love to have a job where I am my own boss, and I get to 
        set my own hours. Hopefully, one day, this dream will become a reality.</p>
